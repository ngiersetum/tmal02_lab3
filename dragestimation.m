% LAB 3: Drag Estimation (A340-300)
%   Calculations of different statistical correlations from an external
%   data set on different aircraft types.
%
%   Code should be run in isolated sections to obtain certain plots,
%   otherwise they will overwrite each other. As long as the first section
%   is run once to load in the data, every section can run in any order.
